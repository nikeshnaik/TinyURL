### Usage:

1. Use `create_user` endpoint and Grab the `api_dev_key` for that user given in the response
2. Encode the long URL to short using `encode_url` endpoint and grab the short key in response
3. For now, open new tab and enter following link: `www.cloned-link.com/{short_key}` and you should be redirected to decoded URL.
